# README

## How to:

`README`'s are files with instructions on how to download your repo. They contain steps and how-to's.

1. [Fork the Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to your own github account
2. [Download your forked repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) locally using either `git clone`, `github gui`, or the `download zip option`
3. Make and save changes locally using `git add <filename>` and `git commit -m "<message>"` but be sure to create a new branch to avoid merge conflicts. `git checkout -b <new_branch>`
4. Set your remote to point to your forked repo `git remote -v` and `git remote add <your-repo>`
5. Finally push your changes to your repo and create a pull request to the orignal repo. `git push origin <new-branch>`

For more instruction on git can be found in the [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) tutorial and [Github documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
